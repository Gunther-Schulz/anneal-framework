## V-2. One mechanism — inspection; transitions are operator-judged

**Status: WATCHING.**

**Kind: correctness-watch.** The catcher under watch is the *removed* isolated [READY] gate — closes on an instance where a cross-decision-contradiction or recall-proxy defect that the old gate targeted is instead caught downstream by implement-loopback or verify [ISSUES FOUND] (the accepted residual catchers), or escapes past them.

**Decision (`glossary.md`, `core.md`).** The framework has one
reusable mechanism: inspection (with an ad-hoc or standardized lens
source). Phase transitions — chiefly [READY] — are not a self-passed
gate on accumulated state; [READY] surfaces the design for the
operator's judgment, and the other transitions are specified
directly by the phase specs and the orchestrator.

**Why uncertain.** This is the lean rework. An earlier model
classified mechanisms as inspection *or* gate and had the run
self-pass a [READY] gate on its tracker tags. A diagnosed failure —
a cross-decision contradiction that passed three [READY] evaluations
(F21) — showed the gate cached a verdict that went stale as the loop
moved the design. The rework cut the gate machinery on that
diagnosis; it is a design call from one failure, not a measured one.

**Production signal to watch.** Whether design defects the old
[READY] gate aimed to catch now reach implement and verify, and
whether catching them there is acceptably cheap — or whether they
slip past verify too. Also whether any mechanism appears in real runs
that is not inspection, which would reopen the need for a mechanism
taxonomy.

**First signal (2026-05-22).** The Unit-3 run (under 0.7.0) is the
first real-run evidence. It surfaced F17/F18/F19 — design decisions
marked [READY] on recalled counts where the basis rule (`core.md`
§3.2) requires a search — and F21, a cross-decision contradiction.
The 0.7.0 isolated [READY] evaluation caught some recall-proxy
errors, missed F21 (it checked decisions singly, never pairwise), and
once false-confirmed a [READY] that implement-start then
contradicted; the operator caught ~2 of ~5 defects by plain review.
Reading: F17–F19 are a basis-rule *adherence* failure — the rule
existed and was correctly rendered; the AI ran the protocol and did
not follow it. The rework removed the isolated evaluation, so
post-0.8.0 that recall-proxy class has no catcher before the
operator's review — the named, accepted residual. It is not a
missing mechanism; adding one was the 0.7.0 reflex this rework
reversed.
