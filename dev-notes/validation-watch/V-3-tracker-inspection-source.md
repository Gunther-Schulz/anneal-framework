## V-3. The tracker does not mark a finding's inspection source

**Status: WATCHING.**

**Decision (`modules.md` §3.1).** A tracker finding is a status tag,
a one-sentence summary, and its evidence — it does not record whether
it came from an ad-hoc inspection or a standardized lens. Findings
from both sit undifferentiated in the one finding track. Standardized
coverage is identifiable separately — the per-cycle standardized-pass
artifact (§3.2) accounts for every lens — but not from a finding's
own form.

**Why uncertain.** An ad-hoc inspection that comes back clean
produces a coverage-shaped result ("X checked, clean"); recorded as a
[VERIFIED] finding it is indistinguishable from a standardized lens's
cited-clean line, and can read as protocol coverage when it is a
one-run addition — building a false model of what the protocol
systematically checks. Observed once: a Clippy run recorded an ad-hoc
pairwise cross-decision coherence check in finding form, which read
as protocol-prescribed. A per-finding lens-source marker was judged
not worth it — the investigation pass is mostly ad-hoc, so the marker
would be near-universal noise. Left as-is on one low-severity
occurrence.

**Production signal to watch.** Whether an ad-hoc clean-check, read
as protocol coverage, misleads a real [READY] ratification, or the
pattern recurs across runs. If so, the fix is not a per-finding
field: anchor the [READY] coverage statement to the standardized lens
set, and have an ad-hoc check's clean result labelled as ad-hoc (or
kept out of finding form).
