## V-1. Standardized lens timing — per-cycle incremental

**Status: WATCHING.**

**Decision (`core.md`).** Standardized lenses are applied every
cycle, incrementally: each cycle's standardized inspection pass
applies the lenses whose scope that cycle's work touched.

**Why uncertain.** Chosen on the fail-safe principle — when
uncertain, check more and check earlier — not on evidence. The one
grounding incident applied the standardized lenses only as a late
correction pass, which was a low-adherence artifact, not a design
choice. There is no comparison between per-cycle and end-only
application; the quantitative value of per-cycle over end-only is
unverified.

**Production signal to watch.** Whether per-cycle standardized passes
mostly come back clean. If they routinely find nothing and findings
cluster only near [READY], end-only sweeping may suffice and
per-cycle is overhead. If per-cycle passes catch things early —
before the design locks them in — per-cycle is confirmed.
