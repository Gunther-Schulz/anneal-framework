# Backlog — open items for the anneal-framework project

The carry-across-sessions list of framework work. **The folder IS the
index:** every open item is one file here, so `ls` shows the live backlog.
Closed items move to `archive/`. Per-item detail lives in each file; this
README is the **ordered** view (what to do, in what order).

## Convention (the process)

- **Relate before add — never blindly append.** Check a new item against
  the existing ones *first*: does it **fold into** one (same canonical
  referent → merge, don't duplicate)? Does it **inform** existing items, or
  do they **inform** it (→ revise the affected ones)? The backlog is a
  corpus too — it fragments if you just append.
- **One file per item, one naming scheme: `<slug>.md`.** Name it for what the
  item *is* (a stable identity), not its type or status.
- **Status lives in the file, not the name.** Each item's first lines state
  what it is, its status/stage, where deeper detail lives, and the next action.
- **When an item ships / closes:** `git mv` it into `archive/`.
- **Memory:** one pointer ([[project-framework-backlog]]) auto-loads and says
  "read `dev-notes/backlog/`." Update it only when the *structure* changes.

## Open items

Three parts: the **READ-FIRST block** (current state + next decisions), the **▶ Campaign map**
(the execution view — what runs together as one anneal-dev cycle, in what order), and **the
ordered backlog** (6 tiers, batched by theme — retained for per-item detail + the
fix-before-change rationale). `ls` is the full index. (Last groomed 2026-06-04 — session-4 research
arc + a re-prioritization into the 6-tier order below; re-groomed session 7 — slotted the
session-6/7 spawned items into the tiers, reinstantiation shipped+activated + self-render-urgency
resolved; **session 8 (2026-06-05)** — the two quick-wins + V-15 archived, the sweep ran both passes
+ keystone Move-1 partially shipped, items filed (`method-kernel-soundness-verdict-locus`,
`foundation-register-intent-falsification-anchors`; *continued:* `convergence-sequencing-enforcement`
after the convergence-pass sequencing gap + skill-craft v1.0.58 L3 fix + L1 `f74b145` shipped;
*then-continued:* `ready-machinery-self-attestation` (promoted from sweep) + `instance-domain-invariant-register`
(new architectural surface from a cross-session clippy-bug analysis) + V-30 watch (form-not-binding
class-recurrence) filed, + `instance-reinstantiation` extended with a capability-by-instance matrix
+ clippy semantic-render call-out; **then** `anneal-dev-evaluation-discipline` filed —
render skill-craft v1.0.61's Tier 1/2 (triggering + behaviour-delta signature) into
anneal-dev-the-plugin; **and** Option-C re-tiering: `canonical-scenario-regression-suite`
promoted tier 6 → tier 4 (per-edit method-level Tier-2 measurement); proof-thread items
stay in tier 6 with the v1.0.61 framing note; **then Move 1 of the session-strategy plan executed**:
tier-6 archive sweep — `impl-dispatch-workflow-substrate` archived (work-of-deciding already done),
`framework-blindspot-class-analysis` promoted tier 6 → tier 4 (empirically validated by this session's
dispatch-witness manifest discovery); **and** Move-2 of `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` broadened
from tactical FQ-patch to "dispatch-witness manifest as §3.1 first-class instrument" framing — same
backlog count, sharper item); **then the session-strategy re-assessment landed the ▶ Campaign map** —
the 44 items grouped into **6 coherent drain campaigns + 1 deferred + a meta bucket** (the rate fix:
drain clusters as one cycle each, not one item at a time — see ▶ Campaign map below), and
`proportional-cycle-weight` filed (⑦ stub; no-silent-deferral); **then campaign ② SHIPPED**
(run `campaign2-completeness-rigor`, spec-only release) — 5 items archived, `verify-model-diversity`
dropped-but-open (fork ε), V-31 watch filed, render-debt queued to ⑥. 40 open; **then (later 2026-06-05) the
per-campaign cadence levels + a pre-campaign re-ground/re-evaluate discipline were added to the ▶ Campaign map,
and the stale session-8 NEXT-UP was marked superseded — no count change, 40 open; **then campaign ③ run 1 SHIPPED** (`014b7b0`, run `campaign3-enforcement-fidelity`, spec-only): D3.1 (`core.md §5.1` deferred sub-case (c) deferred-pending-authoring) shipped; `deferred-finding-owed-artifact-forcing-function` + `completeness-search-enforcement` archived; `basis-recorded-query-fidelity` kept watch-as-backlog; 3 items spawned (`convergence-mechanical-pass-value`, `v-entry-is-post-ship-only`, `verify-disposition-citation-reopen-explicit-leg`) → **41 open**; §5.1 render-debt → ⑥; **then the run's post-run review filed `self-hosting-inplace-integrity-clean-precondition` (spec×self-hosting friction) → 42 open** + logged auto-battle datapoint-3; **then (concurrent sessions, accidental — now reconciled) `measurement-harness-mve` filed + Step-0 eval scaffold shipped (`abcb0af`/`025d3f7`, tier 6) and `design-decision-implication-depth-gaps` integrated** (moved from a stray marketplace-clone copy → tier-4 blind-spot cluster as framework-blindspot's empirical core; the campaign-③ side-quest `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` PAUSED mid-run, α/β lifecycle fork) → 44 open; **then filed `post-run-review-failure-class-register`** (the post-run review's self-review should proactively probe a maintained failure-class register — additive to Q1's reactive listing; consolidates V-30/design-decision/blindspot/instance-domain catalogs) → **45 open.**)

### ▶ Campaign map (2026-06-05 — the execution view; READ FIRST)

The rate fix: **stop draining one item per cycle.** The 45 open items group into **6 coherent drain
campaigns** (each = one anneal-dev cycle, weight called per-item in-loop) + **1 deferred** + a **meta
bucket** (handled deliberately, never campaign-drained). This is the master ordering; the 6-tier
section below is retained for per-item detail + the fix-before-change rationale. Folder stays flat —
a campaign is a *view*, not item identity, so no per-campaign folders; `ls` is still the index.

**Order:** ~~②~~ ✅ → ③ → ⑤ → ④a → ④b → ①-light → ①-heavy → ⑥ (last; gated). ⑦ practiced-not-run throughout.
**⚠ SUPERSEDED for the immediate term (DECIDED 2026-06-06) by the proof-first order** — see the
session-9 ▶ NEXT-UP below: **harness+baseline → bounded enforcement-fidelity batch
(`convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` + `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert`) → the
A/B verdict experiment.** This tier order resumes after the verdict (or is itself re-judged by it).
**(② SHIPPED; ③ run 1 SHIPPED 2026-06-05 — `014b7b0`. ③ side-quest `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` **SHIPPED 2026-06-06** (`98e9354`/`5910cf4`, archived — V-entries are post-ship-only). ③ CONTINUES — remaining undesigned items: `core-md-bloat-measure-then-cut` (re-measure post-`f74b145`) · `verified-integrity-consolidation` · `surface-non-task-observations`. **Also shipped 2026-06-06 (out-of-campaign, operator-driven):** the runs-data formalization `run-state-tracked-by-default` (`d0f479a`, method-kernel — run-state TRACKED by default). See session-9 block below for the spawned-item cascade.)**

**Before each campaign starts** *(operator discipline, 2026-06-05):* (1) **re-ground** — invoke anneal-dev per
CLAUDE.md "Development process grounding" (it loads its own foundations + lenses; never from summary or memory);
(2) **re-evaluate** — is this still the right next campaign? The order is a **default, not a lock**; a cheap
"are we doing the right thing?" check fires *before* commit. It usually confirms — the value is that the check
runs, not that it flips the answer.

**Cadence per campaign** — the **persisted hands-off level** (so it need not be re-stated each run). This is the
*cheap realization* of the ⑦ "run-until-(n)" affordance, which itself stays **deferred** (`auto-battle-cadence-mode`):
auto-cycle the investigate→falsify→verify loops in every campaign; the level says **where it halts** + the **weight**:
- **gated-kernel** — auto-cycle loops, but **step-4 (operator soundness) fires per shipped edit** (kernel soundness
  is irreducible). Default for kernel campaigns.
- **fork-first** — a **pre-cycle operator decision** (architectural fork / harness-capability check / decide-ahead)
  gates the campaign *before* any cycle.
- **drain** — auto-cycle through, **light/no step-4** (non-kernel or behavior-preserving relabel) — operator sheds the clicks.
- **deliberate** — operator-paced, **not auto-cycled** (architectural / meta / exploratory; heaviest weight).

  - **①** light = *gated-kernel* (behavior-preserving relabels) · heavy = *fork-first → deliberate* (the
    dispatch-witness-manifest architectural decision precedes any cycle)
  - **②** ✅ was *gated-kernel* (one bundled release, one step-4)
  - **③** *fork-first* (2 forks: completeness-search disposition · basis-query-fidelity n=1) **→ gated-kernel**
  - **④a** *gated-kernel* — was *fork-first* (worktree cache decision); **fork DISSOLVED 2026-06-07**:
    the merge-tree-gated integration design needs no cache decision (`worktree-isolation-and-integration`)
  - **④b** *gated-kernel* (hooks/release) + *skill-craft-gate* (the soft-load-pointer item) + *drain* (instructional-files-streamline)
  - **⑤** *gated-kernel* (anneal-dev self-hosting verify); the eval / regression-net items are **impl-heavy builds**, not pure-spec relabels
  - **⑥** render-conventions = *fork-first* (slot/binding spec decisions) · the re-render = *drain* per instance, gate at render-verify
  - **⑦** *deliberate* — deferred (practiced, not run)
  - **meta** *deliberate* — never auto-cycled

- **① Sweep finish — soundness & binding** *(active workstream; split by weight)*
  - *light (drain):* `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` Move-1 tail (honest-relabel; the parked
    run `move1-tail-honest-relabel`) + Moves 3/4/5 · `convergence-sequencing-enforcement` (rides ⑥)
  - *heavy (deliberate — the dispatch-witness manifest, re-scoped on its OWN merits, not the rate push):*
    manifest = sweep Move-2 · `method-kernel-soundness-verdict-locus` · `ready-machinery-self-attestation`
    · `foundation-register-intent-falsification-anchors`
- **② Verify / impl / investigate rigor — ✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-05** (run `campaign2-completeness-rigor`,
  spec-only release; 5 items archived: `structural-change-dependent-enumeration` (D1/D1.1) ·
  `behavior-change-test-impact-enumeration` (D2.1) · `multiple-working-hypotheses-investigate-design` (D4.1) ·
  `loopback-root-cause-triage` (D5) · `impl-green-on-commit` (D6). `verify-model-diversity` **dropped-not-shipped**
  per fork ε — stays open (held option). Residuals: F-R4b closed; F-R5a → V-31 watch. Render-debt → ⑥.)
- **③ Under-enforced disciplines → structural + core de-dup:** `completeness-search-enforcement` ·
  `verified-integrity-consolidation` · `surface-non-task-observations` · `basis-recorded-query-fidelity`
  · `deferred-finding-owed-artifact-forcing-function` · `core-md-bloat-measure-then-cut`

  `commit-msg-hook-packaging-overmatch` · `instructional-files-streamline` ·
  `skill-craft-soft-load-pointer-discriminator`
- **⑤ anneal-dev method & evaluation:** `anneal-dev-rerender-changeset-by-source-delta` ·
  `anneal-dev-extension-render-gate` · `anneal-dev-impl-skillcraft-gate` · `anneal-dev-evaluation-discipline`
  · `canonical-scenario-regression-suite`
- **⑥ Render conventions + the big re-render** *(LAST — gated; batches the accumulated spec deltas from
  ①–⑤):* `instance-template-slot-scaffolding` · `glossary-binding-table-interface-completeness` ·
  `instance-reinstantiation` (umbrella) · `instance-domain-invariant-register` · `clippy-greenfield-tolerance`
  · *auto-closers fall out here:* `framework-spec-cleanup`, `contract1-depollution-cluster`,
  `clippy-run-findings-dispatch-coupling`
- **⑦ Rate machinery — DEFERRED (practice first, formalize only if proven):** `auto-battle-cadence-mode` ·
  `cross-instance-precedent-discipline` · `proportional-cycle-weight` (thin stub). Not run as a cycle; the
  *practice* (operator calls cycle-weight + auto-battles non-kernel items) runs throughout.
- **Meta / proof-thread / exploratory (deliberate, never campaign-drained):**
  `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment` · `anneal-reliability-measurement` ·
  `framework-blindspot-class-analysis` (+ its empirical core `design-decision-implication-depth-gaps`) ·
  `anneal-adhoc-use-and-graduation` · `planner-instance-exploration` · `generalize-sharpening-skill`

**Coverage:** all 45 items placed (44 prior + `proportional-cycle-weight`); campaign ② SHIPPED 2026-06-05
(5 archived) → 40 open; campaign ③ run 1 (−2 archived, +3 spawned, +1 post-run) + 2 concurrent-session adds (`measurement-harness-mve`, `design-decision-implication-depth-gaps`) + `post-run-review-failure-class-register` → 45 open; **+ `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake` + `post-run-review-nonsensical-cycle-probe` (2026-06-06, both spawned dogfooding the resumed `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` run) → 47 open; **+ `validation-watch-entry-conformance-sweep` (the run's D6 follow-on) + `runs-data-preservation` (operator note) → 49 open; − `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` (SHIPPED + archived 2026-06-06) → 48 open.** Notes 1/4/5 of the 2026-06-06 operator discussion folded into existing items (`post-run-review-nonsensical-cycle-probe`, `instance-domain-invariant-register`, `worktree-isolation-and-integration`); note 3 covered by V-1/V-4 + the standardized-pass/verify mechanism; **+ `replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity` (clippy Unit-5 retrospective carried in by the operator — the behaviors-clause sibling of the shipped `structural-change-dependent-enumeration`) → 49 open; + `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert` → 50 open; + `convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` (clippy Unit-18: the convergence cycle is unenforced → silently skippable in auto-battle; method-kernel) → 51 open; + `framework-intent-vision-statement` (operator step-back — candidate intent articulation, ratify-don't-canonize, low-gating) → 52 open.** **Session 10 (2026-06-06): `purpose-mechanism-clause` SHIPPED (`24fdb5f`; `framework-intent-vision-statement` stays open — asymptote half + ratification remain); +4 items (`disposition-misclassification-shields-design`, `platform-native-vs-anneal-delta`, `l3-prior-art-methodologies`, `anneal-self-improvement-loop`) → 56 open; 10 session-9/10 orphans placed into the campaign batching (see session-10 block).** Nothing dropped.

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-08 session 14 — READ FIRST)

**▶ NEXT-UP (operator-set 2026-06-08 — both from the session-14 leg-decomposition thread):**
1. **`framework-gap-receipt`** — a *periodic, post-hoc, fresh-context* reader of `.clippy/runs/*.passes.md`
   that tallies falsification findings **by class**, detects recurrence, and routes each **lens / framework
   / neither** per the boundary discriminator ("new thing to look *for*" → lens; "change to how looking is
   *structured*" → framework; else → neither, the default). Coarse routing (mechanical- vs intent-route) is
   already free in the artifacts; only fine class-recurrence needs the pass. **Outside the kernel** (a
   reader, not a per-run obligation) → the low-risk first cut; the Q1 caught-side reader, and now the
   automatic **watcher** for the de-priming change (#3).
2. **`intent-falsification-coverage-binding`** — *agreed + ungated* kernel sharpening: bind requirement-
   coverage **completeness** at convergence (every R# served by ≥1 decision — an empty row holds the phase),
   pulling the enumerable coverage check upstream from verify §4.3 (post-implement) to pre-implement; +
   criteria-first re-derived from the **verbatim** request. `core.md` §4.1.4/§3.4.1 kernel edit → anneal-dev.
   Likely **one campaign** with #3 (both are convergence-machinery edits).
3. **`investigation-pass-lens-priming`** — **REMOVAL DECIDED** (operator, 2026-06-08): remove the lens-set
   priming of the *investigation* pass — keep the legs pure. **Ungated, ship-and-observe** (reversible; no
   controlled test — the `framework-gap-receipt` + daily-use is the watch). `core.md` §4.1 kernel edit →
   anneal-dev + kernel-independent verify (which must confirm lens coverage is **edit-set-driven**, not
   investigation-attention-driven). **One convergence-machinery campaign with #2.**

4. **`in-flight-cross-cycle-learning`** *(exploratory / gated — the session-14 capstone, not a decided ship)*
   — the receipt's recurring-class signal run *in-flight*. **Downstream of #1** (reuses its class-tally) and
   the **successor to #3**: Branch A (dynamic earned-priming) is the candidate replacement for the removed
   static priming — **gated on the de-priming observation showing a gap**. Branch B (basin-jump → between-basin
   annealing, the unbuilt half of the framework's namesake) is the independent quality exploration. Design-first.

**Then the session-13-cont order below stays live:** `bidirectional-lens-coverage-tenet` →
`debt-accrual-prevention` → the session-13 order.

*(Both items carry the session-14 conceptual spine in their relates-to: the **2+1 leg model** — 2 dynamic
legs (iteration, independence) + 1 static prosthetic (the lens set) — and the **enumerable/un-enumerable
boundary**, which the receipt's routing discriminator applies to the machinery itself.)*

**Consolidation landed (2026-06-08):** the framework self-improvement *signal* items unified under
**`self-improvement-signal-architecture`** (the caught/missed × known/novel map + the prune analysis: the
receipt/tracker is the *caught* side, self-review the *missed* side — they don't overlap, so self-review is
**not** prunable against the receipt). The **missed-side** items merged → **`self-review-missed-side`**
(absorbed `post-run-review-failure-class-register` → archived; folded `surface-non-task-observations` (b); its
(a) kept standalone). `framework-gap-receipt` is the separate caught-side (Q1). `post-run-review`
scope-narrowing to the missed-side is the owed spec cycle (anneal-dev).

**Also filed (2026-06-08, not yet sequenced):** `in-flight-cross-cycle-learning` — the **fast-loop twin**
of the receipt (same recurring-falsification-class signal, consumed *in-flight* → next cycle, orchestrator-
computed not self-review). Two branches: **patch-sooner** (speed — also the dynamic earned-priming that could
replace the removed static priming) and **basin-jump** (quality — recurrence triggers questioning the design
*basin* / spawning a structural rival; the between-basin annealing the framework's name promises but the
patch-loop doesn't yet do). Downstream of `framework-gap-receipt` (reuses its tally).

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-07 session 13-cont — preceded by session-14 next-up above; order still live)

**▶ CURRENT STATE (end of session 13-cont, all pushed; both repos clean):** after the clippy re-render (below),
a **clippy lens cycle SHIPPED** — `Silent-substitution-at-boundary` extended **bidirectional** (write-side
merge-clobber, the F29 class from a beat-the-books Unit-31 loopback) via anneal-dev (run
`clippy-write-side-boundary`; skill-craft PASS, converged 3 cycles, verify-passed after a cosmetic rewrap;
**coding-clippy `43b11c7` v0.9.96 LIVE** — pushed + `claude plugin update` → cache 0.9.96; run `/reload-plugins`).
The operator's **"bidirectionality is a core tenet"** call settled the extend-vs-new-lens crux.

**Filed this continuation (operator wants the two open ones UP NEXT):** `clippy-write-side-boundary-gap` (SHIPPED
→ archived) · **`bidirectional-lens-coverage-tenet`** (the core tenet + a lens-set audit: which other directional
lenses lack their mirror) · **`debt-accrual-prevention`** (operator strategic insight — Clippy is *trailing
detection*, debt accrues in the seams between units; *prevention bounds Clippy's growing cost*; 3 holes
[no subtraction-forcing-function / residuals-die-in-gitignored-tracker / no mechanism-proliferation check] + 3 fixes +
the coherence/architecture-audit-cadence caveat; frames `deferred-removal-cross-run-obligation-ledger`).
`framework-intent-vision-statement`: my recommendation recorded in-session (ratify the **two-mode core** + home **(a)**
lean Mechanism-clause extension, framed **design-rationale-not-efficacy**) — **pending operator ratification**, not executed.

**▶ NEXT (operator-set 2026-06-07 — the just-added items first, then the session-13 order; re-ground in anneal-dev per cycle):**
1. **`bidirectional-lens-coverage-tenet`** — sweep clippy's lens set for directional lenses missing their mirror
   (Canonical-ID-dropped, Branch-coverage, …); extend bidirectional per the F29 precedent (additive-reflex per lens);
   decide whether the tenet also belongs in skill-craft's lens-authoring discipline. *(clippy + maybe skill-craft.)*
2. **`debt-accrual-prevention`** — the leading-prevention layer: subtraction-forcing-function / supersession-obligation-at-[READY]
   (framework §3.2.2 add-vs-subtract mirror) + checked-in debt register vs gitignored-tracker (cross-run residual visibility) +
   mechanism-proliferation lens (clippy) + coherence/architecture-audit cadence (process). Folds in
   `deferred-removal-cross-run-obligation-ledger`.
3. **then the session-13 order:** `framework-intent-vision-statement` (ratify, per the recorded recommendation) → the
   proof-first batch (`convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` + `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert` → baseline → A/B) →
   the 5-run occurrence-grounded set (below) → `daneel-reinstantiation` (deferred).

*(Session-13 banner below — superseded; history. Its (A) clippy re-render is SHIPPED.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-07 session 13 — superseded by 13-cont; history)

**▶ CURRENT STATE (end of session 13, all pushed; both repos clean):** the **clippy re-render SHIPPED**
(campaign ⑥ / tier-⑥ — the operator's session-12 candidate (A)). Run `clippy-reinstantiation`
(`.anneal-dev/runs/`), 8 cycles + 1 verify-loopback, verify **[PASSED]**; **coding-clippy `298bf88` v0.9.95
LIVE** (pushed; `claude plugin update` → cache 0.9.95; `/reload-plugins` confirmed active). Full re-render of
all 8 plugin files + 3 instance-spec sources from the live spec — the **2026-06-02→06-07 source-delta**
(intent-falsification pass, requirements record + coverage check, §3.1 bind/surface relabel, L1 convergence
sequencing, campaign ②/③, §3.2.1 provenance, §3.2.2 co-producer/emitted-effect, purpose-mechanism,
coupling-rename, citation-firewall, validation-watch folder+strip) + SKILL.md de-bloat (2579→2182). **Matrix
correction:** the backlog's "clippy lags since pre-session-6" was a **stale secondary source** — clippy was
current to 2026-06-02; this rendered the real delta. **Clean dogfood** — the convergence/verify caught real
bugs: cycle-6 mechanical falsified a too-narrow scope search (missed `spec/README.md`); cycle-8 verify caught a
dropped co-producer falsification clause. (My cycle-1 "moderate not heavy" reframe was itself wrong + caught in cycle-2.)

**Filed this session:** `clippy-reference-file-debloat` (D15-deferred reference/phase budget tail: tracker 3880 /
investigate-design 3545 / implement 2319 / foundations 2216) · `firewall-regex-wrap-tolerance` (the firewall
coherence-check regex misses newline-split §-cites — kernel/method robustness). **`instance-reinstantiation.md`:**
clippy ✅ **DISCHARGED**; **daneel** (+ campaign-craft, bauleitplan) still owe the same deltas.

**▶ NEXT — the execution order (operator-set 2026-06-07; re-ground in anneal-dev per CLAUDE.md before EACH cycle):**

**First — two ripe candidates:**
1. **`framework-intent-vision-statement`** — define **V1** (the two-value core); low-gating, and it gives the proof
   thread a V1 to test against.
2. **The proof-first batch** — `convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` + `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert`
   → `measurement-harness-mve` baseline → `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment` A/B verdict. The strategic
   "does the framework actually work" thread (session-9 proof-first order; paused session 11 for compute).
   *(`daneel-reinstantiation` deliberately DEFERRED — not yet.)*

**Then — the ▶ Occurrence-grounded run set** (the standing execution view): every item below was triggered by a
**real run/incident** (not a speculative design-Q), compressed by **shared fix-locus** to **5 anneal-dev runs**
(each run = one cycle, the cluster drained together, weight called in-loop). Run 1's
`convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` is consumed by the proof-first batch above, so Run 1 here carries the remainder.

- **Run 1 — Convergence / disposition enforcement-fidelity** *(§4.1.4 + §5.1 + §4.3 + §3.2 — "does the
  falsify/converge/disposition machinery BIND or load-but-not-fire?")*: `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake`
  · `disposition-misclassification-shields-design` · `verify-disposition-citation-reopen-explicit-leg`
  · `basis-recorded-query-fidelity` · `deferred-removal-cross-run-obligation-ledger` *(+ `convergence-mechanical-pass-value` rides free)*
- **Run 2 — §3.1 / [READY] soundness (the ① sweep)**: `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` (+ Root-Moves 2–5)
  · `ready-machinery-self-attestation` · `method-kernel-soundness-verdict-locus`
- **Run 3 — Post-run-review machinery** *(`post-run-review.md` + the validation-watch register it walks)*:
  `post-run-review-failure-class-register` · `post-run-review-nonsensical-cycle-probe` · `validation-watch-entry-conformance-sweep`
- **Run 4 — Run-lifecycle output (dispatch / release / hooks / checks)**: `dispatch-brief-one-source-of-truth`
  · `release-commit-formation-from-checkpoints` · `commit-msg-hook-packaging-overmatch` · `firewall-regex-wrap-tolerance`
- **Run 5 — anneal-dev method + self-hosting** *(`anneal-dev/spec`)*: `anneal-dev-rerender-changeset-by-source-delta`
  · `anneal-dev-impl-skillcraft-gate` · `self-hosting-inplace-integrity-clean-precondition`
- **Rides ⑥ (next instance re-render, not its own run):** `instance-domain-invariant-register` (new framework slot
  from clippy's bug class) · **`daneel-reinstantiation`** (deferred for now — repeats this session's proven method).

*Everything NOT in this set is a speculative design-Q / tooling / experiment / instance / skill-craft item — see the
▶ Campaign map + 6 tiers below for those + per-item detail. Clustering rationale: shared fix-locus = one coherent
edit, not one-item-per-run.*

*(Session 12 block below — superseded; history. Its NEXT candidate (A) clippy re-render is now SHIPPED.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-07 session 12 — READ FIRST)

**▶ CURRENT STATE (end of session 12, all pushed; tree clean):** the **3 pre-render lens kernel edits
SHIPPED** — §3.2.2 **co-producer + emitted-effect** dependent forms (`49cb453`, run
`enumeration-target-blindness`) and §3.2.1 **provenance** grounded-at-the-producer (`cd2fd2c`, run
`provenance-basis-naming`); worktree + F0 done earlier this session. **▶ NEXT = the clippy re-render (A),
now fully UNBLOCKED — HEAVY, START FRESH** (re-ground in anneal-dev per CLAUDE.md). Full detail + the
render-debt to fold in: **"Session 12 continued #2"** block below. Filed this session:
`forcing-function-dose-discriminator` (the force/surface/build discriminator + the three-fix-shapes cut),
`co-producer-single-source-of-truth-cure`; watch under `lens-crowding-vs-broad-search` (recognition-economy).

*(The three "Session 12 …" sub-blocks below are the chronological detail — historical, READ-FIRST banner above is the live summary.)*

**Session 12 — two items cleared toward "re-render clippy sooner" (worktree + F0) + a foundational
articulation captured. Tree clean + committed: worktree `97981dc`; F0 `05c3f35`/`89a7a63`; proof-model
`98c1cc6`; intent-layer `0eb6952`. (Concurrent session also landed `5f038b5`/`e8248d2` —
`co-producer-format-parity`.)**

**⏵ Session 12 continued (2026-06-07) — the two §3.2.2 lenses bundled + SHIPPED (`49cb453`).** The
operator's "do the two proposed clippy lenses before the re-render" → bundled `co-producer-format-parity`
+ `replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity` into ONE §3.2.2 sharpening (run `enumeration-target-blindness`,
gated-kernel; verify [PASSED] isolated; operator soundness + commit approval): the **emitted-effect**
behaviors form (read the body, not the callers) + the **co-producer** dependents form (search the sink's
writers, not the symbol), inline closed-set licensing + target-role disambiguation, §5.2 de-dup; glossary
+ lens-set renderings. No fourth shape; `modules §3.4` untouched. The convergence cycle caught INT-1/INT-2
(inline licensing + role-disambiguation); honest residuals INT-3/INT-4 (`[VERIFIED — surfaced]`, not
fake-gated). **Archived** (shipped): `co-producer-format-parity`, `replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity`.
**Filed:** `co-producer-single-source-of-truth-cure` (D6 — the structural cure, kept OUT of the §3.2.2
completeness rule) · `forcing-function-dose-discriminator` (operator step-back: when to force / surface /
build — a skill-craft consolidation candidate carrying the cross-session **three fix-shapes** cut:
enforce #1 / sharpen-question #2 / build #3).

**⏵ Session 12 continued #2 (2026-06-07) — provenance SHIPPED (`cd2fd2c`); ALL pre-render lenses now done.**
The (a)/(b) fork settled to **(b)-direction** (operator-locked): provenance homed in the **framework basis
rule** (`core.md §3.2.1` basis-naming edge — a name/label asserting an artifact's meaning/provenance is an
embedded claim grounded at the **producer**, not the use-site label), via run `provenance-basis-naming`
(gated-kernel; verify [PASSED] isolated; #2-sharpen settled by the three-fix-shapes cut + the empirical
2/5-vs-5/5 inertness of the general rule). Convergence dogfood: the mechanical pass caught D1's render-debt
scope omitting the anneal-dev/plugin self-render (INV-2). Soundness: shipped as a recognition-**raiser** with
INT-A recognition-gating honestly surfaced (`[VERIFIED — surfaced]`), not a class-eliminating gate.
**Archived:** `provenance-at-handoff-lens`. **Watch filed:** the recognition-economy/crowding datapoint
under `lens-crowding-vs-broad-search` (first kernel-basis-rule instance — does the added salience trade off
against the broad sweep?). The clippy fire-point (trace-to-producer) + the anneal-dev/plugin self-render = render-debt.

**▶ NEXT-UP — the clippy re-render (A) is now fully UNBLOCKED.** All three pre-render lenses (co-producer +
emitted-effect at §3.2.2, provenance at §3.2.1) are in the kernel; the template/guide/glossary (F0) + the
worktree/cache design are done. Render-debt to fold in: the §3.2.2 + §3.2.1 kernel deltas (anneal-dev/plugin
self-render + clippy's bindings/lens-set re-point) + F-E (binding-table cite re-point) + the worktree
isolation-slot binding. **Heavy — START FRESH** (not on a long session); re-ground in anneal-dev per CLAUDE.md.

1. **`worktree-isolation-and-integration` — RESOLVED** (`97981dc`). The "silent hunk-drop" was **misdiagnosed**
   (9-cell empirical battery: plain cherry-pick/merge **never** silently drop — only `-X ours/theirs` does).
   Design now = **merge-tree-gated integration** (`git merge-tree --write-tree` → halt-loud → `merge --ff-only`,
   never `-X`) + **scope-conformance** + the **escape-theater cut** (drop remote-strip + the cwd-soft-rule; HEAD
   pre/post verify is the real guarantee). Test-parallelism/cache researched: **the isolation invariant extends to
   caches** — each worktree gets a PRIVATE copy via `cp --reflink=auto -r` (COW-instant / full-copy-floor,
   machine- + toolchain-agnostic); share only content-addressed (Go `GOCACHE`, dep caches); **REJECT** shared-
   writable + hardlinked-mutable (the cross-pollination vectors, empirically demonstrated). Enabler: worktrees off
   tmpfs `/tmp` onto the repo's COW volume (reflink works + escape-resistance holds). Design locked; rides the
   clippy re-render's isolation slot. (d) is **solved-not-moot**, gated on the per-unit-testing choice.

2. **F0 render-convention gate — DONE** via anneal-dev run `f0-render-conventions` (5 investigate-design cycles,
   2 fresh-context convergence passes, isolated verify **[PASSED]** + **operator soundness SOUND**; released
   `89a7a63`). Edits: `instance-template/spec/isolation.md` scaffold + README "Required slots" enum + glossary
   **Basis**/**Completeness-claim** now DEFINE the 4 binding-table terms + guide §2 file-vs-section reconciliation.
   **The tier-⑥ clippy re-render gate is CLEARED.**

3. **Foundational (operator-raised reflection: "what does anneal actually do / is this the core?").** Captured the
   **two-lever value model** — falsification/independence (error-detection, INV-3) + convergence/iteration
   (local-optimum-escape) as DISTINCT levers, each with a falsifiable test + pre-committed kill condition — in
   `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment` ("Two-lever model", `98c1cc6`); and folded the **core-of-the-system
   articulation** (the two values counter two AI failure modes — assertion→basis-rule, dropping→complete-state;
   the loop is *machinery*, the two values are the *core*) into `framework-intent-vision-statement` (session-12
   layer, `0eb6952`). That intent item went from blank-"what's-the-intent" to a **ripe seed** — now a strong
   next-session anneal-dev candidate (home: `core.md` Purpose Mechanism-clause or a `VISION.md`, NOT foundation.md;
   the README tagline "Convert AI confidence into AI evidence" already front-doors the trust half).

**▶ NEXT-UP — two ripe candidates, operator picks priority: (A) the clippy re-render** (`instance-reinstantiation`
/ tier ⑥ / campaign ⑥), **(B) the intent statement** (`framework-intent-vision-statement`, seeded above). (A) is
the operator's
actual goal, now **unblocked**: coherent template/guide/glossary + the worktree/cache design + F0 to render
against. **Heavy** — clippy carries *semantic* render-debt since pre-session-6 (intent-falsification pass,
requirements-record machinery; clippy's real bugs trace partly to that lag — see `instance-reinstantiation.md`).
**Start FRESH** (not on a long session); re-ground in anneal-dev per CLAUDE.md. Render-debt to fold in: F-E
(anneal-dev binding-table `core.md→glossary` cite re-point) + clippy's own bindings re-point + the worktree
isolation-slot binding update.

**Filed this session:** `impl-plan-unit-granularity-vs-dispatch` (framework-clarity, operator-raised — does the
[READY]-presented unit count bind the implement dispatch?) · `co-producer-format-parity` (operator-driven, from a
beat-the-books `signal_id` 7-vs-10 dedup bug + clippy run-tracker archaeology — **consumer-enumeration is
consumer/symbol-shaped, so it misses CO-PRODUCERS of a shared-format key**: Unit 26 extended one builder, the
Coupled-change pass saw the other only as an "opaque-key consumer" (`passes.md:15`/`F18`), the `EXISTS` dedup never
matched → already-bet alerts re-fire forever. Batches with the **tier-4 blind-spot cluster** beside
`replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity` / `provenance-at-handoff-lens` / `framework-blindspot-class-analysis`;
tier-placement left to the next grooming pass, matching the provenance sibling). **Two F0 items marked ✅ DONE + archivable**
(`instance-template-slot-scaffolding`, `glossary-binding-table-interface-completeness`).

*(Session 11 block below — superseded; history.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-06 session 11 — superseded by session 12; history)

**Session 11 — a long empirical-validation arc that, through successive operator-driven rigor fixes,
DISSOLVED every apparent positive result and reframed the question. Honest end-state: prompt-level
"anneal disciplines" ≈ act-first once fairly (BLIND) tested; the framework-AS-PROCESS is UNTESTED. Tree
clean + committed. Stopped deliberately mid-thread (operator pacing compute).** Full detail (the live
writeup): `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment.md` — VERDICT + Addendum 1 + Addendum 2.

**The arc (each step superseded the prior framing):**
1. **Froze the `eval/` harness** (`9d14501`): 10 silent-failure tasks + held-out oracles + well-formedness
   gate + `PACK.md`. Reusable.
2. **Synthetic A/B → ties.** Opus one-shots tractable tasks (7 act-first runs all 1.0; clippy same at
   2.5–3.4× cost). (Three-band model — was the mid-session verdict; now seen as one regime, not the answer.)
3. **Real-codebase A/B (operator's clone-at-commit idea)** on **beat-the-books** (real 250-file repo @ a
   pre-fix commit, fresh opus arms, period-drop bug as target). Real bugs surfaced; **the period omission
   missed by everyone**.
4. **Finding-rate ×5/arm** (act-first / vanilla-anneal / adhoc+focused-lenses) → first looked like a
   dose-response ladder **2.6 / 3.4 / 4.4** ("discipline helps + a provenance lens adds").
5. **Operator caught 3 design flaws**, each shrinking the effect: **effort-framing confound** (act-first
   "efficient" vs disciplines "be thorough") · **non-blind task** (the step-list pre-directed attention —
   a crutch that most helps the *weakest* arm) · **prompt-asymmetry** (giving the disciplines block to only
   one arm tests a *checklist*, not the framework).
6. **Clean BLIND re-run** (identical blind task, no effort framing, disciplines-block the only difference),
   ×5/arm → **the gap COLLAPSED**: act-first-blind **~2.2** vs vanilla-blind **~2.4** (tie). The disciplines
   block mostly **redistributes which bugs are found**, not net catch → the ladder was a framing artifact.
7. **THE REFRAME (operator, correct):** all runs varied the **prompt**, single-pass → they test "does a
   review checklist help" (barely, blind), NOT "does anneal-the-framework help." Anneal = a **PROCESS**
   (multi-pass + fresh-context **independent** verify + convergence) = **UNTESTED**.

**Honest net state: no robustly-established positive result survives the rigor fixes.** prompt-disciplines
≈ act-first (blind); the omission is missed by *every single-pass* arm (0/15+); the provenance-directive
result (2/5→5/5) was non-blind → **untested-blind**; the framework-PROCESS is untested entirely.

**Filed/updated this session:** NEW `provenance-at-handoff-lens` (a value's assumed semantics ≠ its
producer's — the one directive with a real, if non-blind, effect) · NEW `lens-crowding-vs-broad-search`
(focused directives may trade off vs open-ended search — the period 3-vs-2 hint) · updated
`anneal-self-improvement-loop` (empirical inputs: judge-by-rate-not-n=1; prune-don't-accrete) ·
`measurement-harness-mve` (harness built + parked).

**▶ NEXT-UP — ONE open decision (operator's; stopped for today): run the framework's *actual* test, or
accept the current honest state and close the proof thread.**
- **The test** (designed in experiment-doc Addendum 2): prompt held **IDENTICAL** for both arms; vary
  **only the process** — Arm A single-pass vs Arm B real anneal cycle (investigate → *separate fresh-context*
  independent verify/falsify → converge); blind; k≥5; + a **blind re-test of the provenance directive**.
  **PREFERRED form (operator, session-11 close):** use REAL artifacts as a factorial — **act-first /
  legacy-monolithic-clippy / modern-anneal-clippy** (the clippy repo's legacy monolithic clippy — no
  falsification/convergence/lenses — which the operator found ≫ act-first in daily use). act-first→monolithic
  isolates *basic structured process*; monolithic→modern isolates *the anneal additions* — which the operator's
  daily use says **ALSO help (NOT gold-plating; an AI mis-extrapolation, corrected).** Operator's lived prior:
  act-first < monolithic < modern, monotonic. So the open Q is whether a **controlled one-shot test can even
  capture** the regime-dependent value the toy reviews missed. Real driver + strong operator prior > synthetic
  Arm B. See experiment-doc Addendum 3 + `eval/realcode-ab/arms.md`.
- **Why it's the *forced* question, NOT goalpost-moving:** the disciplines-*as-prompt* are now shown
  ~inert (blind tie). Anneal = prompt-disciplines + process; eliminate the first → value, *if any*, is in
  the process. So this is **process-of-elimination**, not "escalate to a regime where it might still win."
  (The synthetic→real→blind steps were *confound fixes*; this is a *component elimination*. Supersedes the
  earlier "goalpost-moving / discount enthusiasm" framing.)
- **The real lever is *independence*, not "cycles" per se:** the vanilla disciplines already contain
  "verify/falsify"; a single agent self-applying them added nothing. What a cycle adds is a **fresh context
  that didn't form the original belief** — someone who didn't make the mistake checking for it (the
  framework's named mechanism; we watched it catch F7/F10 in the spec this session). Hypothesis:
  **independent verify > self-verify, disciplines held equal.**
- **But hold a genuine null prior:** if self-applied disciplines are inert, the cycle mostly *enforces those
  same inert disciplines* → it may not help either, in which case the honest read is "anneal adds little on
  this task class." Run it **open to the null**, **pre-committed as TERMINAL** (a tie/miss = the answer; no
  "one more level"). (Minor orthogonal candidate: a specific **lens** like the provenance directive —
  untested-blind — but that's a checklist item, not the framework.)
- **High-information either way:** null → clean kill on catch-rate for this task class; positive → pinpoints
  the value as *independence*, deliverable minimally (bolt on one independent verify pass) rather than the
  whole heavy apparatus.
- **Operational lesson:** dispatch **≤5 parallel** subagents (10-at-once → server rate-limited 5).
  beat-the-books harness recipe: `git archive <pre-fix-commit>` → strip `docs/ .clippy/ .git` (they leak
  the fix) → keep `src/ tests/` → dispatch ≤5. Scratch dirs were `/tmp/bt-eval/*` (ephemeral — findings are
  in the doc; raw runs not persisted).
- **Independent of the proof thread:** the ▶ Campaign map work (③ enforcement-fidelity → ⑤ … below) remains
  the standing non-proof backlog, available anytime.

*(Session 10 block below — superseded; history. Its ▶ NEXT-UP "TESTING / proof-first order" is the thread this
session resolved.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-06 session 10 — superseded by session 11; history)

**Session 10 — shipped the framework-intent Mechanism clause + a deep platform / prior-art grounding;
groomed the campaign map (orphans placed). Ends /clear-clean (pushed).**

1. **`purpose-mechanism-clause` SHIPPED** (`24fdb5f`, method-kernel via anneal-dev; verify [PASSED];
   operator step-4). `spec/core.md` Purpose gained **"Mechanism: structural, not willed"** (the goals
   are secured by structural enforcement, cite §3.1; operator = the irreducible *willed* exception) —
   the **mechanism half** of `framework-intent-vision-statement`; the asymptote/V1 half + operator
   ratification stay open. Render-debt queued (`instance-reinstantiation`). The convergence cycle caught
   2 real defects (F7 §3.1 over-attribution, F10 a tracker mis-cite) — live proof the method works on
   its own spec.
2. **Platform / prior-art grounding (two new items):**
   - `platform-native-vs-anneal-delta`: anneal vs Anthropic official docs — **L1 authoring + L2 hooks
     are platform-native** (lean on them; the skill-craft slim is a *small, fully-grounded tune-up* + a
     citation discipline, NOT a gut — lower-priority than first thought); **L3 (the verified-multi-step
     method) is anneal's genuine core.** The convergence gate must be a **HOOK** (documented primitive),
     not an orchestrator self-check (sharpened into `convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement`).
   - `l3-prior-art-methodologies`: **kill-switch OFF** — no methodology dominates. **APF** (arXiv
     2602.19065) is the near-twin (same conceptual-proof gap) but partitions a *different regime*
     (industrial control-loop) and lacks falsification; self-correction papers (2310.01798/2406.01297)
     **empirically back** anneal's independence + basis rules. anneal can run the validation APF can't
     (instances = testbed; a *lower, designed-clearable* bar) — but must report scope honestly
     (proxy / in-regime).

**▶ NEXT-UP — TESTING (the proof-first order; unchanged + reinforced by the APF thread).** Concrete
first action: **continue `measurement-harness-mve` Step 1** — build the silent-failure task pack to the
5-point rubric (the `merge-config` exemplar is committed), pre-register/freeze, run the **baseline A/B**
— *then* the bounded enforcement batch (`convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` *as a hook* →
`skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert`, re-measure each) → the **A/B verdict**
(`anneal-empirical-validation-experiment`). The whole APF thread reconfirmed this is anneal's single
differentiating + *achievable* move (the one APF structurally can't make). **Parallel low-gating
(anytime):** ratify the rest of `framework-intent-vision-statement`; the (small) skill-craft slim;
`F-prov-framing` on the next kernel touch.

**Backlog hygiene — 10 session-9/10 orphans placed into the campaign batching (preserves the few-runs goal):**
- **Enforcement-fidelity cluster** (loaded-but-inert / structural-enforcement — same diagnosis; *drains
  as ONE post-verdict cycle*; the bound is deliberate, don't expand it): proof-first **bounded batch** =
  `convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` + `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert` (now); the
  rest follow *after the verdict* — `disposition-misclassification-shields-design`,
  `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake`, `replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity`,
  `convergence-mechanical-pass-value` (parked/evidence-gated).
- **Proof / measurement / strategy (meta):** `l3-prior-art-methodologies` + `platform-native-vs-anneal-delta`
  join the proof thread (`measurement-harness-mve`, `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment`,
  `anneal-reliability-measurement`); + `anneal-self-improvement-loop` (operator-raised — tiered
  unattended/operator-gated self-improvement; **GATED on a positive verdict**, the payoff that makes the
  rising run-count self-draining instead of an operator bottleneck).
- **③ verify / de-pollution:** `verify-disposition-citation-reopen-explicit-leg`,
  `validation-watch-entry-conformance-sweep`.
- **⑤ anneal-dev self-hosting:** `self-hosting-inplace-integrity-clean-precondition`.
- **Parallel / low-gating (done on-touch, not their own runs):** `framework-intent-vision-statement`
  (half shipped), `runs-data-preservation` (mostly DECIDED; `F-prov-framing` residual).

**Few-runs check:** every orphan now drains *with* a campaign cycle, not as its own run. The
**enforcement-fidelity cluster** is the coherent new batch sessions 9-10 surfaced — its first 2 items
are the bounded pre-verdict fix, the rest are one post-verdict cycle. (As few runs as possible, as many
as necessary — the cluster is one run, not five.)

*(Session 9 block below — superseded by session 10; history.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-06 session 9 — superseded by session 10; history)

**Session 9 — two runs SHIPPED + a cascade of operator-driven spawned findings; ends /clear-clean (tree committed).**

1. **`v-entry-is-post-ship-only` SHIPPED + archived** (`98e9354`/`5910cf4`). Resumed from PAUSED;
   operator chose β; reworked cycles 3–9 (convergence caught a real over-narrow axis + a collision;
   operator flagged overthinking → minimal design). V-entries are now **post-ship effect-watches
   only** (validation-watch README + CLAUDE.md filing-shape); un-implemented gaps → backlog.
2. **`run-state-tracked-by-default` SHIPPED** (`d0f479a`, method-kernel). The runs-data decision
   (operator-driven, multi-step): the run-state slot is **TRACKED by default, not gitignored**
   (`instantiation-guide.md §5` + `persistence.md` + `bindings.md` + `core.md §4.2.4`); per-instance
   binding (anneal-dev on; framework doesn't mandate downstream); the in-place integrity +
   separate-copy integration **exclude the run-state dir** (work-product-vs-bookkeeping). **`.anneal-dev/runs/`
   is now tracked in THIS repo** (`5910cf4`) — run history version-controlled (resume survives
   clone/clean). Render-debt queued (ALL instances; not behavior-preserving).

**Spawned this session (all filed + relate-linked):** `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake`
(gold-plating brake — additive-reflex w/o requirement-anchor, n=2) · `post-run-review-nonsensical-cycle-probe`
(catch ANY nonsensical cycle) · `post-run-review-failure-class-register` EXTENDED (the operator's
**proving-questions as a design-quality probe-class**) · `design-decision-implication-depth-gaps`
+2 datapoints · `replacement-side-effect-behavior-parity` (clippy Unit-5 — behavioral-parity must
name side-effects invisible to reference-search; grep the bodies not the callers; sibling of the
shipped `structural-change-dependent-enumeration`) · `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert`
(skill-craft's anti-patterns describe-but-don't-fire; fix = trigger-sharpening, NOT adding anti-patterns) ·
`runs-data-preservation` (DECIDED; F-prov-framing cleanup follow-up open) · `validation-watch-entry-conformance-sweep`
(v-entry D6) · `self-hosting-inplace-integrity-clean-precondition` +datapoint (run-state-tracking compounds it; D7 = subset fix).

**▶ NEXT-UP (DECIDED 2026-06-06 — supersedes the ③→⑤ campaign default; RE-GROUND first per the discipline above).**
The strategic call after the operator's "is it worth it / do we ever reach V1?" step-back: **stop
hill-climbing the framework's *internal* coherence (infinite — the AI reasoning-ceiling guarantees
a gap-floor); prove its *external* value — but test at a representative-best state, not a
known-leaky one.** The order:
1. **Harness + baseline** — continue `measurement-harness-mve` (Step 0 ran) for a measurable
   yardstick. First, so the fixes below are measurable, not vibes.
2. **The BOUNDED enforcement-fidelity batch** — `convergence-cycle-mechanical-enforcement` (the
   soundness hole: convergence silently skippable in auto-battle), then
   `skill-craft-antipatterns-loaded-but-inert`. Re-measure after each. **This batch IS the whole
   pre-test fix-list** — bounded, NOT "the clear failures" open-endedly (the bound is what keeps
   fix-first finite vs the infinite loop). Both share the diagnosis *behavioral rule loaded-but-
   doesn't-fire → structural enforcement, not more rules.* (Method-kernel + skill-craft-canonical →
   anneal-dev + operator soundness / skill-craft self-review.)
3. **The verdict** — run `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment` (the A/B) when the metric
   **flattens** (that flattening, not a feeling of doneness, = "good enough to test"). A real
   possible outcome: it doesn't beat baseline → the honest kill/pivot signal. **This is the
   terminal that ends the never-ending gap-hunt** — V1 = the structural-enforcement asymptote
   reached to a tolerable residual AND measurably validated.
- **Deferred behind the above:** ③'s remaining housekeeping (`core-md-bloat-measure-then-cut`,
  `verified-integrity-consolidation`, `surface-non-task-observations`) → ⑤ etc.; the other
  session-9 spawns (brake / proving-questions / depth-gaps / replacement-side-effect) slot
  tier-4/meta, behind the proof order.
- **Parallel low-gating tracks (do anytime; don't block the order):** `framework-intent-vision-statement`
  (ratify + place in `foundation.md` — half of what makes V1 definable) · `F-prov-framing` quick
  spec cleanup (next kernel touch).

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-05 session 8 — superseded; history)

**⏵ Session 8 *continued* (2026-06-05, later) — sequencing-enforcement gap found + skill-craft L3 fix
shipped; L1 anneal-dev fix in progress; the Move-1-tail run PARKED.** While running the Move-1 tail
(FQ-5 hook relabel + dev-process:438), the orchestrator ran the convergence cycle's two falsification
passes **in parallel** instead of sequenced (intent-first, mechanical-only-if-clean — `core.md §4.1.4`);
the **operator caught it**. Root-caused across levels → new item **`convergence-sequencing-enforcement`**:
- **L3 (skill-craft) SHIPPED v1.0.58** (`9771523`, pin 1.0.57→1.0.58 installed): the missing authoring
  discipline for conditionally-dependent *independently-dispatchable* steps (encode the dependency in the
  dependent's input + cite it) + the enforcement-register **salience** fix (proportionality elevated to the
  Layer-2 intro; new "Scope precedes default" principle; 12th review-checklist item "Salience / reading order").
- **L1 (anneal-dev kernel) SHIPPED `f74b145`** (run `l1-convergence-pass-sequencing`, operator step-4-approved):
  `core.md §4.1.4` + `modules.md §3.3/§3.4` — mechanical pass's input carries this-cycle's intent-clean verdict
  + artifact cites it + coverage-check clause (v) rejects a mismatch + prose names the structural bind. **The
  convergence cycle's own intent pass caught a carry-forward legitimacy hole → D7 removed the carry-forward
  optimization** (intent runs every convergence cycle). Render-follow queued to `instance-reinstantiation` (ALL
  instances; not behavior-preserving). `convergence-sequencing-enforcement` now L3+L1 shipped (archives when the
  render batch carries L1's delta).
- **⏸ PARKED — the `move1-tail-honest-relabel` anneal-dev run** (tracker `IN-PROGRESS`, `.anneal-dev/runs/`).
  Stopped mid-investigate-design at **cycle 2**: design locked (D1-D4 [VERIFIED] — FQ-5 hook PASS-line relabel
  + dev-process:438 "un-fakeable evidence" relabel + defer-FQ-B), convergence cycle NOT yet run. **Resume:**
  re-invoke anneal-dev (resumes from the tracker); only the convergence cycle → [READY] → implement → verify
  remain. No timeline set. (Tail of the sweep's Root-Move-1, beside the shipped keystone `819e84e`.)

**Session 8 — the `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` RAN (both passes) + its keystone Root-Move-1
PARTIALLY SHIPPED.** The session-7 NEXT-UP executed end-to-end: the two quick-wins, then the sweep, then
the first fix.

1. **Two quick-wins SHIPPED + archived.** `anneal-dev-plugin-dangling-anti-patterns-ref` (one-line render
   fix, `26ac662`) — and its **step-4 discharge became the live seed probe** that opened the sweep
   (`1ae472f`). `validation-watch-entry-retrofit` (`5c187ee`) — the active V-entries gained
   watch-kind/catcher fields; **V-15 archived** in the same pass.
2. **`intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` — FIRST + SECOND PASS DONE (8 targets; `cd75248` + `1023f5a`).**
   First pass: the 3 hooks (commit-msg / run-gate / skill-craft-pre-edit) + step-4 design. Second: the
   structural-enforcement practices + the **§3.1 keystone** + the falsification machinery + the
   intent-falsification pass *itself* (the recursion). **Convergent verdict:** enforcement certifies **form**
   (a string is present), not **binding** (the verification happened) — BUT the **foundation is SOUND**
   (operator-irreducible gate + strong-surfacers); the defect is **localized OVERCLAIM** (surfacers sold as
   binding gates). The ~25 granular FQs **reduce to 5 root moves** (in the item). **⚠ Self-catch:** the sweep
   found **V-26's archival *earlier this session* was a circular error** (spec-closure can't certify
   spec-correctness) → **reversed; V-26 restored WATCHING.** Only **scope-item-2** (shipped run artifacts)
   remains unswept.
3. **Root-Move-1 (THE KEYSTONE) — PARTIALLY SHIPPED `819e84e`.** The honest **bind-vs-surface relabel**:
   `spec/core.md` §3.1 (producer-independence bind test + F-B operator-detection fence) +
   `development-process.md` practices 10/11/12 + step-4 + `glossary.md` + `foundation.md` +
   `instantiation-guide.md`. A method-kernel anneal-dev run (`move1-s3.1-honest-relabel`), operator
   step-4-approved; render-follow queued to the render-debt batch (D7). **Still in Move-1 scope, NOT yet done**
   (separate sites/cycles, noted in the item): the commit-msg hook's green-✓ output relabel (FQ-5) · the
   falsification "holds" labels (FQ-B·pass7) · the `development-process.md:438` "un-fakeable evidence"
   reconcile (`c5adcbb`).

**Spawned this session:** `method-kernel-soundness-verdict-locus` (NEW — the [READY]-vs-step-4 split: *which*
operator soundness verdict binds *where* for a kernel edit; surfaced by running move-1, finding F-B) ·
`foundation-register-intent-falsification-anchors` (NEW — external-anchor source-map for the register). New
sweep target logged: the **[READY] / fresh-session-implementability machinery** (the readiness verdict is
orchestrator-self-attested; move-1's cycle-2 self-PASS under-detected, the fresh-context convergence cycle
caught the real refinements). `auto-battle-cadence-mode` got **dogfood datapoint 2** — the move-1 run was
driven by "auto-cycle until (n)", validating the (b) affordance (halt-at-[READY], menu-persistence, mid-cycle
interjection all held).

*(2026-06-05: the items below are folded into the ▶ Campaign map above — sweep = campaign ①, F0/tier-5 =
⑥, etc. Ordering now lives in the map; these blocks are retained for per-item detail.)*

**▶ NEXT-UP** ⚠ **SUPERSEDED by the ▶ Campaign map (2026-06-05): ③ is next, not ①.** The sweep (campaign ①) is now
sequenced *late* (①-light → ①-heavy, after ⑤/④). This block is retained for the Root-Move detail only. *(Original,
superseded:)* **finish Root-Move-1's residual sites, then Root-Moves 2–5
(each its own anneal-dev cycle; the queue lives in `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep`).**
1. **Close Move-1's tail** — FQ-5 (commit-msg green-✓ relabel) + FQ-B·pass7 (falsification "holds" labels) +
   dev-process:438 — all the same honest-relabel concept, deferred from `819e84e` to avoid widening that
   release.
2. **Then Root-Moves 2–5.** **Move-2 [ARCHITECTURAL FORK] dispatch provenance** — the one lever that converts
   surfacers→binding; **needs the operator's "bind-harder vs honest-relabel" decision + a harness-capability
   check** (can it witness spawns?) before it runs. **Move-3** carry-every-caveat-to-its-point-of-use.
   **Move-4** cheap external checks (verdict-form parsing FQ-1 / mechanical-N/A validation FQ-2). **Move-5**
   falsification-enum completeness (**the root of the V-26 reversal**). Plus the **Bash-bypass
   reconsideration** (promote from "accepted" — it nullifies every hook fix).

*(Session 7 history below.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-04 session 7 — superseded; history)

**Session 7 — `anneal-dev-model-tier-policy` SHIPPED (spec-only, release `3d03d0c`; archived).** The
blanket top-tier **dispatch model-tier floor**: every anneal-dev dispatch runs at the configured top
tier (value `anneal-dev.config/model-tier.md` = opus), downgrading forbidden; floor-not-guarantee
framing. Instance-level per foundation contract 3 (no framework touch — framework stays harness-agnostic,
mechanically confirmed). Its own anneal-dev run (method-kernel edit; kernel-independent verify =
skill-craft self-review + operator soundness on INV-3/F8).

- **Standout result:** the convergence cycle's **intent-falsification pass** (a session-6 addition the
  *running* plugin doesn't even carry yet) caught a real gap the 8 standardized lenses missed — the floor
  was *absent-by-default* in installed-elsewhere projects → drove the **D5 bootstrap flip**. Conformant-success
  for the session-6 intent-falsification work.
- **Soundness residual (operator accepted):** INV-3/F8 — the blanket pin runs verify on the *same tier as
  the actor*, foreclosing the cross-tier model-diversity lever; trade accepted for now (held open in
  `verify-model-diversity`).
- **Spawned:** `anneal-dev-self-render-urgency` (the render-cadence "stale-while-idle" rationale fails for
  the self-governing instance) · `cross-instance-precedent-discipline` (no forcing-function for sibling-instance
  prior art; the clippy precedent was found late). V-29 got an n≥1 data point (register focus = scope-shrink,
  not judgment-shrink).
- **Renamed:** `multivoter-verify-no-predicate-claims` → **`verify-model-diversity`** (multi-voting is DEAD;
  the intent-falsification pass SHIPPED; the live residual is model-diversity-for-verify, which collides with
  the model-tier floor — F8).

**▶ `anneal-dev-reinstantiation` SHIPPED + ACTIVATED (session 7, 2026-06-04).** The full
`instance-reinstantiation` render scoped to anneal-dev *itself*: re-rendered the plugin from the live spec
(intent-falsification pass + mechanical-rename, `[VERIFIED — surfaced]` disposition, requirements record +
coverage check, model-tier floor) across all 5 affected files; **verify PASSED** (separate-context
render-fidelity battery clean); released `02e7ee2` (step-4 discharge) + `5edf6cd`, pushed; `claude plugin
update` → **0.1.3 LIVE** (cache verified carrying the render; `/reload-plugins` swapped it in-session). The
running anneal-dev now carries its own method. Dogfood: the run used the very intent-falsification pass it
was rendering (grounded in live spec, not the stale loaded skill). Spawned:
`anneal-dev-plugin-dangling-anti-patterns-ref` (pre-existing dangling cite, low-sev).

**▶ `anneal-dev-self-render-urgency` RESOLVED + archived (session 7).** Not via faster renders — via
recognizing **re-grounding already does the job**: the project `CLAUDE.md` "Self-hosting" clause now makes
the **live co-located spec the source of truth** (the loaded plugin is a build artifact that may lag; live
spec governs on divergence). Plugin-freshness → **hygiene** on the existing batched cadence; the "urgency"
is gone. Self-hosting-only (a downstream anneal-dev has only its plugin → plugin IS its truth). Release
`e7542eb`. Net new machinery: zero.

**▶ NEXT-UP (DECIDED session 7 — do after a fresh `/clear`): two quick-wins, then open the
intent-falsification sweep fresh.**

1. **Quick-wins first** (close items, keep velocity): `anneal-dev-plugin-dangling-anti-patterns-ref`
   (one-line render fix — qualify the dangling `references/anti-patterns.md` cite as skill-craft's) +
   `validation-watch-entry-retrofit` (mechanical: active V-entries gain the watch-kind / catcher fields).
2. **Then `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` — bounded FIRST PASS.** The retrospective audit of the
   enforcement floor (the prospective half — every future run carries the intent-falsification pass —
   shipped + went live this session). Risk-ordered first slice: the **3 hooks** (`commit-msg` discharge,
   `anneal-dev-run-gate`, `skill-craft-pre-edit`) + the **step-4 discharge machinery** — exactly where the
   n=1 seed (B1/B2: self-dischargeable enforcement + overclaimed gate) lived. Method per target:
   fresh-context, criteria-first intent-falsification — state the mechanism's intent, then attack whether
   it actually *binds* (self-dischargeable / overclaimed / operator-detection-dependent / false-comfort).
   **Single check, not multi-vote.** The sweep is an AUDIT → dispatch the passes directly (NOT an
   anneal-dev run); output = a triaged **fix-queue**; each confirmed finding then becomes its own
   anneal-dev cycle. Cap the pass; log what's left unswept. **Why ahead of F0:** it audits the floor every
   run leans on (incl. this session's); F0 only unblocks the idle tier-5 re-render. (F0 render-conventions
   — `instance-template-slot-scaffolding`, `glossary-binding-table-interface-completeness` — stay
   tier-2-next after.)

*(Session 6 history below.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-04 session 6 — superseded; history)

**Session 6 — two method-kernel anneal-dev runs SHIPPED (both spec-only; instance renders deferred to
the batch). The foundation-self-certification arc + its dogfooding consequence.**

1. **`foundation-invariants-register`** (release `35cc329`; item `foundation-self-certification-machinery`
   archived) — the anchor-gated **foundation-invariants register** (`dev-notes/foundation-invariants/`: 5
   externally-anchored kernel invariants + README) + the per-touched-invariant focusing artifact wired into
   the method-kernel-edit verify (`development-process.md` §2 / step-4) + the `Invariant-change-ratified`
   protection (`hooks/commit-msg`). Surfacer, not certifier; operator stays irreducible. Watch **V-29**
   (focus-payoff, WATCHING).
2. **`intent-falsification-convergence-pass`** (shipped this commit) — the **intent-falsification pass**
   (judgment-class design-vs-intent soundness check) in core anneal's convergence cycle (`core.md` §4.1.4) +
   the new **`[VERIFIED — surfaced]`** finding disposition + the artifact (`modules.md` §3.4.1) + glossary
   terms + persistence binding. A pure SURFACER (operator-irreducible for kernel edits; never self-certifies).
   **Validated by 4 recursive-dogfooding rounds — the pass run on its own design caught + fixed B/F/S-class
   soundness flaws** (the session's standout result).

**▶ NEXT-UP (operator-chosen, after /clear): `anneal-dev-model-tier-policy`.** anneal-dev work always uses
the top model tier (never cost-downgraded) — rule in `anneal-dev/spec`, value in `anneal-dev.config`. Its own
anneal-dev run (method-kernel edit). Self-contained: design sketch + home + relate in the item.

**Spawned this session (dogfooding + operator probes):** `framework-blindspot-class-analysis` (tier 6) ·
`intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` · `canonical-scenario-regression-suite` ·
`deferred-finding-owed-artifact-forcing-function` · `verify-model-diversity` reframed (the
intent-falsification kernel-candidate — now SHIPPED prospectively as run 2) · `loopback-root-cause-triage`
n≥4. Render-debt: both runs queue into `instance-reinstantiation`.

*(Session 5 history below.)*

### ▶ Where we are + next steps (2026-06-04 session 5 — superseded; history)

**Session 5 — three method-kernel anneal-dev runs SHIPPED (all spec-only; instance renders deferred to
the batch) + a new enforcement hook. Dogfooding validated: runs 2 & 3 came out of using anneal-dev on
itself.**

1. **`verify-vs-original-requirements`** (release `1d93e58`) — verify now checks the locked design's
   coverage of a captured **requirements record** (intent-correct channel beside planned-vs-actual).
   Honest residual V-28 (never-captured requirement), WATCHING.
2. **`kernel-consolidation-batch`** (release `e6abcc8` + folder `d008afe`) — `validation-watch.md` → a
   **folder** (file-per-entry + README + `archive/`); the 3 misfiled glossary terms relocated; the
   render/spec/adherence-gap triage consolidated to one home (practice 1); "edit cycle" disambiguated.
3. **`validation-watch-lifecycle-fix`** (release `78be6e8` + `0aa04e3`) — the **opportunity-exercised**
   closing rule (a watch closes when the failure's *opportunity* arose and the fix handled it — caught,
   or produced-clean; pure non-occurrence never closes), the **correctness-watch / quality-watch** split,
   n=1 justified, and the **archive-check** (recurrence/regression net + n=1 safety hatch).

**New: `hooks/anneal-dev-run-gate.py` (project-local `.claude/settings.json`).** Blocks Edit/Write to the
kernel source (`spec/*.md`, `foundation.md`, `development-process.md`, `post-run-review.md`,
`instantiation-guide.md`, `anneal-dev/spec/*`) unless an anneal-dev run is `IN-PROGRESS` — i.e. **spec
work must go through anneal-dev** (now enforced at edit-time, not just at commit). Bypass:
`touch .anneal-dev/allow-adhoc-kernel-edit` (15-min self-healing TTL, non-silent). **Needs operator
approval (project hook) to activate next session.**

**▶ NEXT (operator-chosen, 2026-06-04): `foundation-self-certification-machinery`.** Lighten the
operator's soundness role on kernel edits (catch known-invariant breaks mechanically; the operator stays
irreducible). See that item's **"NEXT-UP" section** — start by settling the design forks WITH the operator
(decide-ahead), THEN run anneal-dev. (It edits `development-process.md` → the run-gate hook will require an
active run, so they compose.)

**Also open (from this session):**
- **Run B — `core-md-bloat-measure-then-cut`** (the deferred core/modules consolidation half: core↔modules §4.1.4/§3.4 dedup + glossary-indexes-core-bodies).
- **The render batch — `instance-reinstantiation`** now queues **3** source-deltas (the 3 runs above) for the clippy/daneel re-render.
- **`validation-watch-entry-retrofit`** (lazy: the 26 active V-entries gain the new kind/catcher fields).
- The **render-cadence policy** (framework runs ship spec-only) + the **interactive auto-cycle affordance** (`auto-battle-cadence-mode`, design resolved, not built).

**Session 4 (prior — the operator-flagged research thread):**

Session 4 executed the **operator-flagged research thread** end-to-end: **four `deep-research`
runs** (placement / design-first-vs-act-first / process-literature / verify-techniques), all
adversarially verified, verdicts + raw reports captured (`dev-notes/research/*.raw.json`; commits
`e2ef6f2` + `4da569d` on `main`). Headline: **no superior framework found (kill-switch OFF)**;
anneal is **strongly validated** by canonical methodology literature; and **design-first is
unrefuted-but-UNPROVEN** — the deciding experiment has never been run by anyone, and anneal's
instances are the testbed to run it. (Concurrency lesson: 3 runs at once overloaded the
schema-verifier subagents → **run deep-research one at a time.**) The 4 run-items are **archived**
(verdicts summarized below; raw in `dev-notes/research/`).

**Run verdicts (now in `archive/`):**
- placement — Process-discipline layer; **APF = a peer (not unique), no superior**; APF lessons folded.
- design-first-vs-act-first — No superior (kill-switch off); design-first unrefuted-AND-unproven;
  act-first dominance ≈ cheap-oracle benchmark artifact.
- process-literature — Canonical RE/methodology **validates** anneal (basis rule = Zave-Jackson
  "designation"; complete-state = S,K⊢R; loopback = Platt recycle).
- verify-techniques — **Criteria-first verify = standout adoptable**; quorum marginal
  (model-diversity > vote-count).

**⭐ Candidate KERNEL sharpenings surfaced — findings, NOT yet edits; each needs an anneal-dev cycle.**
Two literatures converge on a *"carry rivals → exclude rivals"* posture (see tier 4 + the F1 verify
batch):
- *Investigate-side:* `multiple-working-hypotheses-investigate-design` (the genuine GAP — resolve the
  internal-rivals-vs-committed-recommendation tension first).
- *Verify-side:* criteria-first verify · exclusion-obligation · falsifiability-gate · different-model
  verifier · decompose judgment claims (across `verify-model-diversity`,
  `verify-vs-original-requirements`).

**The proof path (operator's "prove me right or wrong"):** `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment`
(v0 — falsifiable design-first-vs-act-first A/B on instances, expensive-verification regime) +
`anneal-reliability-measurement` (token-first + grounding-ratio metrics). In tier 6 *only* because
they're meta (not framework/clippy fix/change) — high interest, not low value.

**Next decisions (operator's call):**
1. **Pursue one kernel sharpening via anneal-dev** — *criteria-first verify* is lowest-cost /
   highest-confidence (peer-reviewed; attacks rubber-stamping; convergent across two runs).
2. **Design the MVE experiment** (`anneal-empirical-validation-experiment`).
3. **Resume the framework track** (tiers 2 + 5 below) — the coherence-audit-driven framework fixes,
   then the re-render.

**⚙ Render-cadence policy (operator-decided 2026-06-04).** Framework-change anneal-dev runs (tiers
2 + 4) ship **spec-only** — they edit the kernel and do **NOT** render into instances per-run. Renders
batch **once** into tier-5 `instance-reinstantiation`, which now carries a **render-debt queue**: each
spec-only run appends its source-delta there, and the batch renders the accumulated delta into every
instance in one pass (method: `anneal-dev-rerender-changeset-by-source-delta`). This operationalizes
the tier rationale below ("*or you render twice*") at the **run** level — and matches the framework's
own decoupled model (`render-and-open-diff` fires post-verify, never inside a spec-change run's verify).
First applicant: the `verify-vs-original-requirements` run **SHIPPED 2026-06-04** (spec-only release
`1d93e58`, archived); its per-instance renders (U2/U3/U4) deferred to the batch (queued in
`instance-reinstantiation`). Instances stay transiently stale — tracked, low-urgency while idle (drift ~0).

### Session history (context, not work)

- **Session 3 (2026-06-03):** landed the keystone `corpus-flows-redesign` (one channel = anneal-dev;
  three entry-conditions; the anneal-dev↔anneal-framework merge; enforcement floor) + the live
  release (F7 resolved). Archived (release-record `4e77837`). Surfaced 5 method-kernel findings (now
  in the framework tiers below). **The old Phase A–D structure is superseded by the tiers below.**
- Phase-A render-conventions already DONE + archived: `harness-tool-runstate-unsourced` (`8b8a4ac`),
  `cite-glossary-not-section-numbers` (`b56f7d8`).

## The ordered backlog (2026-06-04 re-prioritization)

Order = **near-done → framework fixes → clippy fixes → framework changes → clippy changes → rest.**
Rationale: finish the almost-done; then *fix* (close gaps in existing behavior) before *change* (add
new); and **framework before clippy at each tier** — clippy renders *from* the framework, so fix /
change at the source first (practice 1) or you render twice. Level = **root (fix-at-source)**, not
where it surfaced. Within tiers, items are **batched by theme** (resolve a batch in one campaign/run,
not one-at-a-time). `ls` remains the full index; every item is workable individually, in any order.
**(2026-06-05: the ▶ Campaign map above is now the execution grouping — these tiers are retained for
per-item detail + the fix-before-change / framework-before-clippy rationale, which the campaigns respect.)**

### 1 ▸ NEAR-DONE
**Finish-now:** none open. (`skill-craft-pre-edit-hook-findings` **CLOSED + archived 2026-06-04** —
F4 hook spec-origin reminder scoped to anneal-instance renders [sibling-`spec/` detection, verified];
F2 `mv`/`cp` Bash-bypass accepted as a known limitation; F3 residual filed →
`anneal-dev-impl-skillcraft-gate`, now in tier 4.)

**Auto-closing — NO action; each archives when its dependency lands (do not try to "work" these):**
- `framework-spec-cleanup` → archives when `instance-reinstantiation` (tier 5) lands.
- `contract1-depollution-cluster` → archives when validation-watch **V-26** resolves (needs a built
  non-code instance) + the parked render-debt (now folded into `instance-reinstantiation`).
- `clippy-run-findings-dispatch-coupling` → archives when the coherence-audit deep-sweep (tier 2 —
  §4.4 / §5.1 / mode mechanics) lands + Cycle 2.5 (deferred into `planner-instance-exploration`).
  (NOTE: the 2026-06-04 cadence audit was kernel-wide / on-demand-fleshing — it did NOT target this
  specific §4.4/§5.1/mode-mechanics deep-sweep; this tail remains open.)

### 2 ▸ FRAMEWORK FIXES — close gaps in the existing kernel / dev-process (root-at-framework)
**Vehicle: the coherence-audit-driven campaign — audit ✅ RAN 2026-06-04** (handoff
`ac39b6ab6d5d929cd`; cadence baseline reset from `ac1856832b8712fda`). Verdict: kernel structurally
sound, keystone coherent, no domain-leakage; load-bearing-lens (1+8+9) finding count = 5. Findings
captured → the F-batches below (F1 confirmations) + the new `kernel-consolidation-glossary-hygiene`
(cluster: triage-3-homes · dev-terms-in-glossary · "edit cycle" gloss · `core.md` §4=52% bloat with 2
measured movable points). The **`core.md` bloat question** is now *measured* (no de-bloat rewrite —
the 2 movable points live in that item). Fixes are separate anneal-dev cycles (the audit was the
floor). **F0 render-conventions gate the tier-5 re-renders — do them first.**
- **F0 — render-convention (gate tier 5): ✅ DONE 2026-06-07** (anneal-dev run `f0-render-conventions`,
  verify [PASSED] + operator soundness SOUND): `instance-template-slot-scaffolding` (the slot-as-file-vs-
  section fork was already settled live; closed via isolation.md scaffold + README enum + guide §2
  reconciliation) · `glossary-binding-table-interface-completeness` (glossary Basis/Completeness now
  define the 4 binding-table terms). **The tier-5/⑥ re-render gate is CLEARED.** Render-debt: anneal-dev
  binding-table cite re-point (F-E, rides the re-render). Both items archivable.
- **F1 — verify/impl discipline gaps** (`core.md` §4.2/§4.3 + `development-process.md`):
  `verify-vs-original-requirements` (✅ **SHIPPED 2026-06-04**, spec-only `1d93e58`, archived — render
  debt queued in `instance-reinstantiation`) · `behavior-change-test-impact-enumeration` ·
  `impl-green-on-commit` (✅ audit-confirmed spec-silent L7-a).
- **F2 — structural / dependency enumeration** (dogfooding-surfaced; highest-leverage):
  `structural-change-dependent-enumeration` (n=2) · `loopback-root-cause-triage`.
- **F3 — under-enforced / fragmented disciplines** (soft-rule → structural; consolidate):
  `completeness-search-enforcement` (decide its open question first) · `verified-integrity-consolidation`
  · `surface-non-task-observations`. **✅ SHIPPED 2026-06-04** (run `kernel-consolidation-batch`, release
  `e6abcc8`/`d008afe`): `validation-watch-entry-archival` (validation-watch → folder, archived) +
  `kernel-consolidation-glossary-hygiene` A/B/C (triage-one-home, glossary-vocab relocate, edit-cycle
  disambiguation, archived). **Remaining:** `core-md-bloat-measure-then-cut` (Run B — the core/modules
  half of the consolidation, split out; core.md §4.1.4↔modules §3.4 dedup + glossary-indexes-core-bodies).
- **F4 — dispatch / parallel-isolation mechanics** (root framework §4.2 + render; surfaced via clippy):
  `dispatch-brief-one-source-of-truth` · `worktree-isolation-and-integration` (mixed-level: also
  harness; placed here as fix-at-source).
- **F5 — dev-process / release machinery:** `release-commit-formation-from-checkpoints` ·
  `commit-msg-hook-packaging-overmatch` · `instructional-files-streamline`.
- **F6 — skill-craft / hooks:** `skill-craft-soft-load-pointer-discriminator` (+ the hook-findings
  residual in tier 1).
- **F7 — enforcement-fidelity gaps (session-6/7 dogfood):** `basis-recorded-query-fidelity` (the
  recorded basis-query isn't mechanically enforced, only conclusion-correctness is; n=1) ·
  `deferred-finding-owed-artifact-forcing-function` (a finding deferred to a to-be-authored
  validation-watch entry *owes* that entry; nothing forces it to exist) ·
  `validation-watch-entry-retrofit` (mechanical: the active V-entries gain the new watch-kind /
  catcher fields — a quick-win).

### 3 ▸ CLIPPY FIXES — instance-level corrections (root-at-clippy)
Sparse on purpose: most clippy-surfaced findings are framework-root (→ tier 2, fix-at-source).
- `clippy-greenfield-tolerance` — clippy `verify` assumes existing code; greenfield hardening.
- `anneal-dev-plugin-dangling-anti-patterns-ref` — anneal-dev's `tracker.md` render cites a dangling
  `references/anti-patterns.md` (skill-craft's); pre-existing, low-sev, one-line fix that rides the
  next anneal-dev render.

### 4 ▸ FRAMEWORK CHANGES — new disciplines / larger kernel additions (each = an anneal-dev cycle)
- **The convergent "carry rivals → exclude rivals" sharpenings** (from the literature runs; two
  independent sources point the same way):
  - *investigate-side* `multiple-working-hypotheses-investigate-design` — the genuine GAP; resolve the
    internal-rivals-vs-committed-recommendation tension first.
  - *verify-side* `verify-model-diversity` (reframed: model-diversity, not vote-count)
    + the criteria-first / exclusion-obligation / falsifiability-gate / different-model sharpenings
    (partly captured in `verify-vs-original-requirements`, tier 2 — the *fix* and the *change*
    converge; sequence them together).
- **anneal-dev method:** `anneal-dev-rerender-changeset-by-source-delta` ·
  `anneal-dev-extension-render-gate` (downgraded — D4 answered the core question) ·
  `anneal-dev-impl-skillcraft-gate` (NEW 2026-06-04 — dispatch *loads* but doesn't *invoke*
  skill-craft → the pre-edit gate blocks dispatched rule-corpus edits).
- **method evaluation (per-edit discipline; renders skill-craft v1.0.61's Tier 2 at the method level):**
  `canonical-scenario-regression-suite` — promoted from tier 6 2026-06-05. Executable verification
  *for the method itself*: a regression net so a spec change can't silently break a known-good
  scenario. Per-edit cadence (every spec change runs it) — Tier-2-shaped behaviour-delta signature
  measurement at the method level, sibling to `anneal-dev-evaluation-discipline` (which renders
  Tier 1/2 at the **plugin** level). Composes with V-30 closing rule (provides the empirical
  per-edit input the watch tracks).
- **blind-spot enumeration (proactive, not by-accident):**
  `framework-blindspot-class-analysis` — promoted from tier 6 2026-06-05.
  Empirically validated this session: the dispatch-witness manifest discovery (sweep
  Move-2, broadened to a §3.1 first-class instrument) is exactly one such blind-spot
  class found by accident — confirming the item's premise that enumeration-instead-of-
  accident is right. Must use EXTERNAL lenses (framework can't introspect its own
  blind spots — Gödel). Output feeds tier-4 changes + `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep`.
  - **empirical core (NEW 2026-06-05, integrated from a stray marketplace-clone copy):**
    `design-decision-implication-depth-gaps` — 3 confirmed blind-spot classes with **production
    instances** (clippy beat-the-books) + candidate fixes; the *results* to framework-blindspot's
    *method*. The unifying shape ("saw the fact, didn't connect it to the decision" = reasoning-depth
    at design-lock) is **framework-level** — recurs in anneal-dev's own work (the campaign-③
    `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` side-quest is a fresh instance). Fixes route by level: Class 2
    (execution-context) → clippy lens; Class 1 (input-dimension) → clippy lens-sharpen OR a framework
    body-shape (d) parameter-completeness check; Class 3 (write-without-reader) covered by convergence
    `target-dependents`. Framework-level open Q: do intent/convergence suffice for the reasoning-depth
    shape, or is a forcing function warranted? NOT campaign ③.
  - **where the classes GO (NEW 2026-06-05):** `post-run-review-failure-class-register` — the post-run
    review's self-review should **proactively probe a maintained failure-class register** (for each
    catalogued class: did this run exhibit it?), additive to Q1's reactive defect-listing + the
    open-ended novel-class probe; consolidates the scattered catalogs (V-30 (i)–(iv) · design-decision's
    3 · blindspot · instance-domain primitives). Regression-guard (catches KNOWN classes), NOT a
    reasoning-depth-ceiling fix; must stay additive (not blinders). Framework (`modules.md` §4 +
    `post-run-review.md`); the consumer-end of framework-blindspot's enumeration.
  - **process-waste sibling (NEW 2026-06-06):** `post-run-review-nonsensical-cycle-probe` — the
    post-run review should catch **any** nonsensical/wasted cycle (operator-clarified), not only
    protocol-forced grind (Q3 today scopes to that → misses orchestrator-discretionary self-inflicted
    waste, e.g. this session's gold-plate-then-revert). Distinct object from the failure-class register
    (process-level wasted *cycles* vs output-defect *classes*); shares the additive/open-ended discipline.
    Detective-general counterpart to the preventive-single-shape `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake`.
- **mode-mechanics / disciplines:** `auto-battle-cadence-mode` (interactive "auto-cycle to [READY],
  halt at the phase gate" affordance — direction resolved, not built; the thing we did by hand this
  session) · `cross-instance-precedent-discipline` (candidate — a forcing-function to check sibling
  instances for prior art; evaluate "earns a lens" vs "just investigate harder" first) ·
  `convergence-surfaced-finding-action-brake` (NEW 2026-06-06 — the orchestrator actions intent-pass
  `[VERIFIED — surfaced]` findings as D-deltas with no requirements-anchored brake → scope-inflation /
  convergence-loop amplification; caught dogfooding the `v-entry-is-post-ship-only` run. Same
  surfacer-vs-bind family as campaign ① / `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` — consumer side).

### 5 ▸ CLIPPY / INSTANCE CHANGES — the big re-render (gated by F0 above)
- `instance-reinstantiation` — **umbrella** (now incl. the 3 folded bundles: render-resync, SKILL.md
  de-bloat, CLAUDE.md seed re-point): re-render the cleaned spec into the instances via anneal-dev
  (anneal-dev DONE → clippy [heavy] → daneel → campaign-craft → bauleitplan), de-bloating the
  legacy-bloated ones, render-fidelity-verified. Idle instances (drift ~0) → low urgency.

### 6 ▸ REST — meta / exploratory / new-instance (doesn't fit the fix/change axis)
- **Operator-flagged proof thread (high interest, NOT low value):**
  `anneal-empirical-validation-experiment` (v0 — the falsifiable design-first-vs-act-first A/B) +
  `anneal-reliability-measurement` (token-first + grounding-ratio) +
  `measurement-harness-mve` (the HOW — wires skill-creator's runner to the A/B; method-level,
  sibling to the plugin-level `anneal-dev-evaluation-discipline` in tier 4). *(Mild disagreement
  with "rest": these are your "prove me right or wrong" thread — here only because they're meta,
  not framework/clippy fix/change.)* **Now being acted on (2026-06-05):** `measurement-harness-mve`
  Step 0 ran — seam proven end-to-end, scaffold committed at `eval/` (`abcb0af`); Step 1 (the
  silent-failure task pack) is next. Step 0's cheap-oracle null reproduced this tier's own
  "act-first dominance ≈ cheap-oracle benchmark artifact" caveat. **2026-06-05 framing update** (per
  skill-craft v1.0.61's evaluation discipline + the C-option re-tiering decision): these are
  **Tier-3 isolated-grade shape** at the framework level — one-shot validation that anneal-the-method
  is itself sound, distinct from the per-edit regression net (`canonical-scenario-regression-suite`,
  now in tier 4). Kept here as proof-thread items, not under-valued. Compose with V-30
  (`form-not-binding-class-recurrence`): the A/B's outcome would be one of V-30's data points.
- (*`framework-blindspot-class-analysis` was previously listed here; **promoted to tier 4** 2026-06-05
  — empirically validated by this session's dispatch-witness discovery; the item's premise that
  enumeration-instead-of-accident is right is now confirmed. See tier 4.*)
- **Retrospective audits (high-leverage; each generates a fix-queue, not a single edit):**
  `intent-falsification-soundness-sweep` — audit *already-shipped* enforcement (the `hooks/`, the
  step-4 discharge, the self-classified "structural enforcement" rules) for the self-certifying-form
  blind spot the intent-falsification pass was built to catch. The prospective half is DONE (every
  future run now carries the pass, live as of session 7); this is the retrospective cleanup. n=1 seed
  caught a 2-for-1 the mechanical pass confirmed clean past. **Strong candidate to promote out of
  tier 6** — it audits the floor every run leans on. (*`canonical-scenario-regression-suite` was
  previously listed here; **promoted to tier 4** 2026-06-05 — per-edit cadence + Tier-2-shaped
  measurement discipline. See tier 4.*)
- **Exploratory (no rush):** `anneal-adhoc-use-and-graduation` · `planner-instance-exploration`
  (new instance) · `generalize-sharpening-skill` (cross-repo tooling).
  (*`impl-dispatch-workflow-substrate` was previously listed here; **archived 2026-06-05** — its own
  status was already "no change recommended now; captured so it isn't re-derived"; the work-of-deciding
  was done. Decision preserved in `archive/`.*)
